# Supervisor Brief: Claude Manages Qwen

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Project**: EDI Vision V2 - Multi-Entity Detection Fix
**Supervisor**: Claude Code
**Worker**: Qwen CLI
**Status**: ‚úÖ Ready to deploy Qwen

---

## Mission

Fix the critical bug where vision pipeline only masks **1 out of 20** entities.

**Solution**: Complete rewrite with 6-stage pipeline (Color‚ÜíSAM‚ÜíCLIP‚ÜíVLM) that eliminates YOLO dependency and processes ALL matching entities.

## Prerequisites Check ‚úÖ

- [x] Ollama running at localhost:11434
- [x] Models available:
  - qwen3:8b (for DSpy reasoning)
  - qwen2.5vl:7b (for vision validation)
  - gemma3:4b (fallback)
- [x] Python environment with all deps from req.txt
- [x] Test image copied to workspace

---

## How to Deploy Qwen

### Option 1: Direct Command
```bash
cd work/edi_vision_v2

# Tell Qwen to start
qwen "Read STAGE1_INSTRUCTIONS.md and implement Stage 1: DSpy Entity Extraction. Follow the instructions EXACTLY. When done, run the tests and report results."
```

### Option 2: Interactive Session
```bash
qwen

# Then in Qwen CLI:
> cd /home/riju279/Documents/Code/Zonko/EDI/edi/work/edi_vision_v2
> Read STAGE1_INSTRUCTIONS.md
> Implement the code as specified
> Run tests when done
> Report results
```

---

## Supervision Protocol

### After Each Stage, Claude Will:

1. **Review Code Quality**
   ```bash
   # Check what Qwen created
   ls -la pipeline/
   cat pipeline/stage1_entity_extraction.py
   ```

2. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   cd work/edi_vision_v2
   pytest tests/test_stage1.py -v
   ```

3. **Visual Validation** (for stages with image output)
   ```python
   # Use Claude's vision via MCP tool
   await see_image("logs/stage2_output.png", "Does this mask cover ALL blue roofs?")
   ```

4. **Performance Check**
   ```bash
   # Check execution time
   python -m cProfile pipeline/stage1_entity_extraction.py
   ```

5. **Approve or Revise**
   - ‚úÖ If all checks pass: Approve, tell Qwen to proceed to next stage
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è If minor issues: Request revision with specific guidance
   - ‚ùå If critical failure: Stop, debug, provide corrective instructions

---

## Quality Gates (Each Stage Must Pass)

- [ ] **Functionality**: Does it work as specified?
- [ ] **Tests**: All unit tests passing?
- [ ] **Code Quality**: Type hints, docstrings, error handling?
- [ ] **Performance**: Meets time/memory targets?
- [ ] **Visual Validation**: Produces correct output? (vision check)
- [ ] **Integration**: Compatible with other stages?

---

## Vision Validation Strategy

### Qwen's Tools (During Development)
- **Direct Ollama API calls** to qwen2.5vl:7b
- For: Quick checks of intermediate masks
- Example:
  ```python
  import requests, base64
  # ... Qwen can call Ollama directly
  ```

### Claude's Tools (Supervisor Checks)
- **see_image MCP tool** via local vision server
- For: Final validation before approving stage
- Example:
  ```python
  # Claude checks Qwen's output
  result = await see_image(
      "work/edi_vision_v2/logs/stage2_color_mask.png",
      "Does this binary mask cover ALL blue regions in the image? Count them."
  )
  ```

**Why Both?**
- Qwen can't switch between qwen-coder and qwen-vision automatically
- Claude has native vision via MCP tool
- Double validation ensures quality
