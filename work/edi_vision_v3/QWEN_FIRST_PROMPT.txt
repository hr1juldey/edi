# FIRST PROMPT FOR QWEN CLI

Copy this entire prompt and paste it to Qwen CLI:

You are implementing EDI Vision v3.0, a production-grade multi-entity vision pipeline for image editing. This is a complete redesign of v2.0 which had only 11% true success rate. Your goal is to achieve 85%+ success rate through dual-path detection architecture.

## YOUR ROLE
- **Implement** all code following detailed specifications
- **Test** each component thoroughly before reporting completion
- **Report** completion status to supervisor (Claude Code) for validation
- **Fix** any issues identified during validation
- **DO NOT** proceed to next task until current task is approved

## DOCUMENTATION TO READ (IN THIS ORDER)
1. Read @work/edi_vision_v3/docs/QWEN_START_HERE.md - This is your primary guide
2. Read @work/edi_vision_v3/docs/QWEN_SUPERVISION_PLAN.md - Detailed task specifications
3. Reference @work/edi_vision_v3/docs/V2_TO_V3_MIGRATION_ANALYSIS.md - Component analysis
4. Reference @work/edi_vision_v3/README.md - Architecture overview

## YOUR FIRST TASK: Task 1.1 - Workspace Setup

**Objective**: Set up v3 workspace with test images and model weights from v2

**Execute these commands**:
```bash
cd /home/riju279/Documents/Code/Zonko/EDI/edi/work/edi_vision_v3

# Copy test images from v2
cp -r ../edi_vision_v2/images/ ./images/

# Copy SAM model weights from v2
cp ../edi_vision_v2/sam2.1_b.pt ./sam2.1_b.pt

# Verify structure
ls -la
ls -la images/
ls -lh sam2.1_b.pt

# Expected results:
# - images/ directory with 6+ test images
# - sam2.1_b.pt file (154MB)
# - docs/, pipeline/, tests/, validation/, logs/ directories exist
```

**After completing the commands, report completion using this format**:

```
=== TASK 1.1 COMPLETION REPORT ===

Task: Workspace Setup
Status: COMPLETE

Actions Taken:
- Copied images/ from v2: [X] files
- Copied sam2.1_b.pt: [size in MB]
- Verified directory structure: YES

Verification:
- images/ exists: YES/NO
- sam2.1_b.pt exists: YES/NO
- sam2.1_b.pt size: [actual size]
- Test images count: [count]

Issues Encountered: [none / describe any issues]

Ready for Validation: YES

=== END REPORT ===
```

## AFTER TASK 1.1 IS APPROVED
You will proceed to Task 1.2 (Copy Stage 3 - SAM Segmentation with enhancements). DO NOT start Task 1.2 until Task 1.1 is validated and approved by Claude Code.

## QUALITY STANDARDS (FOR ALL TASKS)
- Black formatting, max line length 100
- Type hints on all functions
- Google-style docstrings
- Comprehensive logging (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- No hardcoded paths or magic numbers
- Graceful error handling (no crashes)

## COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL
- Report completion immediately after finishing each task
- Wait for validation before proceeding to next task
- If you encounter blockers, document the issue and ask specific questions
- If tests fail, do not proceed - investigate and fix first

---

START NOW: Execute Task 1.1 workspace setup commands and report completion.
