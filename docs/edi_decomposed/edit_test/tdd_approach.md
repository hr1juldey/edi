# EDI Development Approach Using TDD

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach for implementing the EDI (Edit with Intelligence) CLI tool. The approach emphasizes minimizing wasted effort while ensuring robust, reliable software through strategic test placement and incremental implementation.

## Core TDD Principles for EDI Development

### 1. Red-Green-Refactor Cycle
Every feature implementation follows the classic TDD cycle:
- **Red**: Write a failing test that defines desired behavior
- **Green**: Implement minimal code to pass the test
- **Refactor**: Improve code quality while maintaining test coverage

### 2. Test Pyramid Implementation
- **Unit Tests** (70%): Individual functions and class methods with mocked dependencies
- **Integration Tests** (20%): Component interfaces and subsystem interactions
- **End-to-End Tests** (10%): Core user workflows with minimal mocking

### 3. Strategic Mocking Approach
Given EDI's dependency on external AI services and models:
- Extensive mocking of LLM responses for deterministic testing
- Mock implementations of SAM/CLIP models for vision processing
- Simulated ComfyUI API endpoints for integration testing
- In-memory databases for fast storage layer testing

## Development Sequence Strategy

### Phase-Based Implementation
1. **Foundation First**: Core utilities, data models, and storage layer
2. **Subsystem Development**: Independent implementation of vision, reasoning, integration
3. **Orchestration**: Connecting subsystems through pipeline and workflow management
4. **Interface Layer**: CLI commands and TUI implementation
5. **Advanced Features**: Optimization, performance enhancements, user experience improvements

### Dependency Management
- Implement components in dependency order to minimize rework
- Use dependency injection to enable easier testing and mocking
- Abstract external services behind interfaces for loose coupling
- Create adapter patterns for third-party library integrations

## Testing Efficiency Framework

### Fast Feedback Mechanisms
1. **Unit Test Optimization**:
   - Mock all external dependencies
   - Use pytest fixtures for consistent test data
   - Focus on logic paths rather than implementation details
   - Employ parametrized tests for similar scenarios

2. **Resource Management**:
   - Automatic cleanup of temporary files and directories
   - In-memory databases for storage tests
   - Shared fixtures for expensive setup operations
   - Parallel test execution where thread-safe

3. **Deterministic Testing**:
   - Eliminate randomness in test data
   - Mock time-dependent functionality
   - Fixed seeds for pseudo-random operations
   - Reproducible test environments

### Quality Assurance Measures

#### Code Coverage Requirements
- **Core Logic**: 90%+ coverage for business-critical functions
- **Subsystem Interfaces**: 85%+ coverage for component boundaries
- **CLI Commands**: 80%+ coverage for user-facing functionality
- **UI Components**: 75%+ coverage for interactive elements

#### Performance Benchmarks
- **Image Analysis**: <5 seconds for standard images (2048px max)
- **Prompt Generation**: <6 seconds for 3-refinement iterations
- **Validation Loop**: <8 seconds for re-analysis operations
- **Memory Usage**: Within system constraints (12GB RTX 3060)

#### Reliability Standards
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling for all external dependencies
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback mechanisms for service failures
- **Data Integrity**: ACID compliance for session persistence
- **Recovery Systems**: Checkpoint and restore capabilities for interrupted operations

## Risk Mitigation Through Testing

### AI Model Dependencies
1. **Extensive Mocking**:
   - Comprehensive mock responses for deterministic testing
   - Simulated latency and error conditions
   - Varied response qualities for robustness testing

2. **Fallback Mechanisms**:
   - Smaller model alternatives for memory constraints
   - Local processing for critical operations
   - Caching strategies to reduce external calls

3. **Validation Layers**:
   - Input sanitization for all AI interactions
   - Output validation for generated content
   - Rate limiting and quota management

### External Service Integration
1. **Adapter Pattern Implementation**:
   - Abstract interfaces for all external services
   - Easy swapping between real and mock implementations
   - Consistent error handling across service types

2. **Resilience Testing**:
   - Network failure simulations
   - Timeout and retry scenario testing
   - Service degradation handling

3. **Configuration Management**:
   - Environment-specific service endpoints
   - Runtime configuration of service parameters
   - Secure credential management

## Implementation Constraints and Considerations

### Resource Limitations
1. **Hardware Constraints**:
   - 12GB VRAM limitation affects model selection
   - CPU/GPU memory management strategies
   - Efficient resource allocation for concurrent operations

2. **Time Constraints**:
   - 24-hour development sprint focus
   - MVP feature prioritization
   - Incremental delivery approach

3. **Solo Developer Model**:
   - Automated testing to reduce manual QA burden
   - Documentation-driven development
   - Self-verifying code changes

### Technical Debt Management
1. **Code Quality Enforcement**:
   - Automated linting and formatting
   - Static analysis tools integration
   - Consistent coding standards

2. **Refactoring Opportunities**:
   - Regular code reviews through testing improvements
   - Technical debt tracking through test coverage gaps
   - Incremental architecture improvements

3. **Knowledge Preservation**:
   - Comprehensive test suite as executable documentation
   - Clear commit messages and changelog maintenance
   - Inline documentation for complex algorithms

## Success Metrics and Validation

### Quantitative Measures
1. **Test Coverage**: >85% overall, >90% for core functionality
2. **Build Performance**: <5 minutes for complete test suite execution
3. **Defect Rate**: <1 critical bug per 1000 lines of new code
4. **Performance**: Meet all documented timing requirements

### Qualitative Measures
1. **Developer Experience**:
   - Clear error messages and debugging information
   - Intuitive API design verified through tests
   - Comprehensive documentation coverage

2. **User Experience**:
   - Predictable command behavior validated through E2E tests
   - Helpful guidance during error conditions
   - Responsive feedback during long-running operations

3. **Maintainability**:
   - Low coupling between subsystems verified through testing
   - Clear separation of concerns in test structure
   - Easy onboarding for new contributors

## Conclusion

This TDD approach for EDI development balances the need for rapid implementation with robust quality assurance. By strategically placing tests at different levels and using extensive mocking for external dependencies, we can achieve fast feedback cycles while maintaining confidence in the software's correctness. The phased implementation approach ensures that foundational components are solid before building more complex features, reducing the risk of major rework and keeping the development process efficient and focused.
