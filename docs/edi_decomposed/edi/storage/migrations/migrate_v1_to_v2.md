# migrate_v1_to_v2()

[Back to Migrations](../storage_migrations.md)

## Related User Story
"As a user, I want EDI to continue working properly after software updates." (from PRD - implied by maintainability requirements)

## Function Signature
`migrate_v1_to_v2()`

## Parameters
- None - Migrates the database schema from v1 to v2

## Returns
- Boolean - True if migration was successful, False otherwise

## Step-by-step Logic
1. Check current database version to confirm it's v1
2. Create backup of current database before making changes
3. Add new columns to existing tables as required for v2:
   - Add any new fields to sessions table
   - Add any new fields to prompts table
   - Add any new fields to entities table
   - Add any new fields to validations table
4. Update table schemas according to v2 requirements
5. Transform any existing data to match new schema requirements
6. Update the version table/flag to indicate schema is now v2
7. Run verification to ensure migration was successful
8. Return success status (True/False)

## Migration Changes from v1 to v2
- Add new columns to support additional functionality
- Update data types if needed for better performance
- Create new indexes for improved query performance
- Add constraints to ensure data integrity
- Preserve all existing data during migration

## Safety Measures
- Creates database backup before starting migration
- Uses transactions to ensure atomic changes
- Performs verification after migration to confirm success
- Handles errors gracefully and can potentially roll back
- Logs all migration steps for debugging if needed

## Input/Output Data Structures
### Migration Result
Returns Boolean:
- True: Migration completed successfully
- False: Migration failed, database unchanged or rolled back

### Schema Versioning
- Tracks current schema version in a dedicated table or file
- Ensures migration only runs on compatible versions
- Allows for multiple sequential migrations
