# image_to_ansi_art()

[Back to UI Utils](../ui_utils.md)

## Related User Story
"As a user, I want to see my images displayed in the terminal interface." (from PRD - implied by TUI requirements)

## Function Signature
`image_to_ansi_art(path, max_width) -> str`

## Parameters
- `path` - The file path to the image to be converted
- `max_width` - The maximum width of the output in terminal characters

## Returns
- `str` - A string containing ANSI escape codes and characters that represent the image visually in the terminal

## Step-by-step Logic
1. Load the image from the provided file path
2. Calculate the appropriate dimensions to fit within max_width while preserving aspect ratio
3. Resize the image to the calculated dimensions
4. Map the image pixels to terminal colors using ANSI color codes
5. Convert the image to a character representation using techniques like half-block characters or braille characters
6. Generate the ANSI escape sequences needed to display colors in the terminal
7. Return the complete string that displays the image when printed to the terminal

## Terminal Display Technology
- Uses ANSI escape codes for color representation
- Employs special Unicode characters for better resolution (half-blocks, braille)
- Optimizes for 80Ã—24 minimum terminal size
- Handles color depth limitations of terminal environments

## Performance Considerations
- Resizes images to prevent excessive character output
- Balances visual quality with terminal performance
- Optimizes for fast rendering in the TUI
- Handles various image formats efficiently

## Input/Output Data Structures
### Input
- Image path: String path to an image file (JPG, PNG, etc.)
- Max width: Integer representing maximum width in terminal characters

### Output
- String containing ANSI escape codes and characters that visually represent the input image when rendered in a terminal
